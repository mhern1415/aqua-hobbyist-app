# Aqua Hobbyist App

Welcome to Aqua Hobbyist! I created this application using an idea I've had for quite some time. As an aquarium hobbyist, this website allows it's users to post "profiles" of their tanks that display a picture of the tank, the tank size, and whatever plants and/or fish that reside in their aquarium.

## Installation

To install this application, clone it by pasting

`git clone https://github.com/mhern1415/aqua-hobbyist-app`

run `rake db:migrate`

run `rake db:seed`

run `shotgun`
